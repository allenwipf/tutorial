<h1>Where's Waldo Game</h1>
<p>This is a game I created while attending Omaha Code School. To play, simply find Waldo as quickly as possible and click on him. Your score will then be saved in a text file on the server. A displayed timer will keep track of the seconds elapsed since the page was loaded. The top 10 fastest times can be viewed by click on "top scores."</p>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>To build this simple app I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, the Ruby framework Sinatra and AJAX. To start you'll need a little HTML markup:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/allenwipf/66d47d84f91459bfe4e3e30d836096ae.js"></script>

<p>What is most important for now is basic HTML with a Waldo Image which you can find with a quick Google search. The <strong>Modal</strong> element is for displaying a box to the player whenever Waldo is clicked on. The <strong>TimerDiv</strong> element is for displaying the timer and the <strong>"circle"</strong> image is for displaying a circle where the player clicks.</p>

<p>After creating the HTML of course you'll need some styling otherwise it will be jumbled mess. I got the modal css from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp">www.w3school.com</a>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/allenwipf/6e4889a946781712cbbb8edadb2f2590.js"></script>

<p>Next lets take a look at the javascript before getting into the backend.>

<h4>The Frontend Javascript</h4>

<p>The only way for users to interact with this game is by clicking so we want to add a few eventListeners. Eventlisteners are added to different elements and fire a function when that event happens. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/allenwipf/3dd7fbe8583c013b969d3fef2d983780.js"></script>

<p>The first eventlistener is added to the Waldo image which will fire a function to check if the click coordinates is within the range of where Waldo is. The second one is to close the the modal box, the third will show the modal populated with the top 10 scores and the last is also for the Waldo image and will show a circle where the player clicked. 

<p>when the image is click, the following function fires which sends sends the coordinates of the click, via an AJAX post, to the server for verification. If the post returnText comes back as "true". The <span class="function">successModal</span> function will fire which shows the modal. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/allenwipf/c4775e431e978878e4999d9bbd45ff2e.js"></script>

<h4>The Backend Ruby</h4>

<p> When the AJAX request fires, posting the click coordinates, the Sinatra framework runs the following function which checks to see if the coordinates are with a specific range and returning true of false accordingly. Ruby handles a couple other functions such as saving scores and retrieving scores and I'll talk about those next as I go over the different features of the game. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/allenwipf/69a22835dd2294c898841b325ec03a76.js"></script>

<h4>Success Modal</h4>

<p>The successModal function does a few things. It fires the <span class="function">stopTimer</span> function which clears the <strong>waldoTimer</strong> object which stops the <span class="function">counter</span> function from updating the timer node, lastly this function adds the find time to a node within the modal and changes the display from "none" to "block"

<script src="https://gist.github.com/allenwipf/7874afa5cc50d500776917c92f84ef6f.js"></script>

<h4>Timer</h4>

<p>At the beginning of the eventlisteners code, if you noticed, the page load time is saved as a variable. Using an interval timer, every 100th of a second the <span class="function">time</span> function fires which takes the time at that moment and subtracts the page load time. The return is then set as the innerHTML value of the element where the counter is displayed.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/allenwipf/67c6cbd454efb727674411bfa8352066.js"></script>

<h4>Highscore</h4>

<p>When "Get High Scores" is click, the <span class="function">highScore</span> function is fired which makes an AJAX Get request to the server and after the Ruby process the request and returns the top scores, this function display the high scores on the modal and set it to 'block'.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/allenwipf/a95fae302920a7b0c78b2f1e53557dcc.js"></script>

<p>Below is both the Ruby code that saves the scores after each Waldo find and the code that retrieves the top 10 scores. Because the scores are saved as a string, there is some processing that has to happen to sort the scores and only retrieve top 10. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/allenwipf/5dd318c10b837e4b381e6af944a9c183.js"></script>

<h4>Mouse Click Circle</h4>

<p>Creating the circle around each mouse click is deceptively simple. When a click is made on the image, the <span class="function">mouseCircle</span> function is fired and the y.page and x.page coordinates of the click are added as top and left alignment for the circle image respectively. The image, which was set to display="none" up to this point, is not set to display="block."
